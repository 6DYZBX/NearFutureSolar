=============================
NEAR FUTURE SOLAR PACK v0.5.4
=============================

This pack contains many modern and fancy solar panels to use on your ships and stations. 

============
INSTALLATION
============

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so. 

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place these advanced solar panels in various high-tech nodes.
