=============================
NEAR FUTURE SOLAR PACK v0.5.5
=============================

This pack contains many modern and fancy solar panels to use on your ships and stations. 

============
INSTALLATION
============

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so. 

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place these advanced solar panels in various high-tech nodes.

============
KSP-MINI-AVC
============

This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745). 
If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only read from the internet and no personal information is sent. 
For a more comprehensive version checking experience, please download the KSP-AVC Plugin (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
